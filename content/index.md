Hi there.

My name's Asim KT. I'm a front end developer from Bangalore, India and Welcome to my site.

This site uses [Phenomic - A static site generator](https://phenomic.io/) and the code for this site is available at
[this GitHub repository](https://github.com/asimkt/portfolio)

<h3>About me</h3>

I work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My current projects used ReactJS as the view-library and I'm lovin' it.
I like eating and making food, Malabar Chicken curry being my special item.

I'm a front-end developer at [Quintype Inc](http://quintype.com/) where I create web-applications for different digital publishers like
[TheQuint](http://thequint.com/) and [BloombergQuint](http://bloombergquint.com/).

In my free time, I created things like:

* [Zpeed](zpeed.in) : A Progressive Web App (PWA) for seeing your realtime speed in km/h. Sure to check this out when you go cycling next time.
* [Image Baker](img-bak.in) : A tool for Android & iOS devs to create their assets in all sizes needed.
* [Heic converter](converter.asimkt.com): A tool to convert the new iPhone Heic format to Jpeg.
