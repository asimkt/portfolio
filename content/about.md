Hi there.

My name's Asim KT. I'm a front end developer from Bangalore, India and Welcome to my site.

I work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My current projects used ReactJS as the view-library and I'm lovin' it.
I like eating and making food, Malabar Chicken curry being my special item.

I'm a front-end developer at [Quintype Inc](http://quintype.com/) where I create web-applications for different digital publishers like
[TheQuint](http://thequint.com/) and [BloombergQuint](http://bloombergquint.com/).
